## About GhostChat

GhostChat is a real-time chat application built with Electron.js, incorporating `Socket.IO`, React, MongoDB, and the Giphy API. It allows users to join or create chat rooms without needing passwords - just a username and room ID. Keep in mind that this app was created as a personal project, which was mainly for learning purposes, so not everything in it is perfect.
